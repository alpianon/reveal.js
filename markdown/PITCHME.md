# Legal framework

+++

## EU and National

EU Directive (**PSI**): What and at which cost

**CAD** (Codice dell'Amministrazione Digitale) brings "_Open Data by default_": under which license, if at all

[**National Guidelines**](http://lg-patrimonio-pubblico.readthedocs.io/it/latest/index.html) on utilization of Open Data (several releases)

+++

## Regional

_Linee guida regionali_ (Regional Guidelines) [[ITA (PDF)][1c94ddee]]

  [1c94ddee]: http://opendata.regione.sardegna.it/informazioni "Introductory page with link to PDF"

+++

## Current status of affairs, nationwide

* No **CC0**
* **CC-BY** advised by National Guidelines
- exceptions (we advise for the contrary)
    - Bolzano
    - ...

# Technical Framework

# Challenges

+++

## Inbound data providers

AKA, legal constraints
* Datasets in part belong to other bodies or private companies
* Mostly CC-BY, some proprietary
* Pictures, the license of which are uncertain; other content
* Pseudo-copyright (?!)



+++

## Data Protection

- Open data by default, but not for personal data
- Conflates  license and data protection
    - In line with WP29 position
    - quite absurd

+++

## Pseudo copyright (?!)

- Art. 107-108 of the Italian Heritage Goods Code (Codice dei beni culturali)
- A duty of care permitting copies of heritage goods (preservation of the object) becomes (by interpretation) a pseudo-copyright on those who take pictures, including of a <span class="fragment"> **SKULL** (yes, Supreme Court has said so...)</span>
- Independently from possibly existing copyright of the author or their heirs, or the expiration of it.
- Condition: must be kept by a public body (the same, if held by a private cultural institution it would be untouched)
- Free only for non-commercial uses
